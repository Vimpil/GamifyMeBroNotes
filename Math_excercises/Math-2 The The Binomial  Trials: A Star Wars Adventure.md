## Part 2: The Binomial Trials

Master Trigonos led the young Jedi apprentices into the next chapter of their training, where they met Master Calculus, a wise teacher known for his love of numbers. With a wave of his hand, Master Calculus conjured holographic challenges, setting the stage for the Binomial Trials.

"These trials," Master Calculus explained with a twinkle in his eye, "will test your math skills in adventurous ways. From calculating the chances of navigating asteroid fields to managing resources to aid communities, you'll use the power of binomial math to tackle tricky situations. So, buckle up, young Jedi, for in these trials, you'll not only sharpen your minds but also pave your path to becoming galaxy-saving heroes!" And with that, the apprentices embarked on their mathematical adventure, ready to crunch numbers and conquer challenges in the name of the Force.

1.
Odrediti x u izrazu
$`\left(2 \times \sqrt[x]{2^{-1}} + \frac{4}{\sqrt[4-x]{4}}\right)^6`$
ako je tre´ci ˇclan razvoja 240.  
the answers are 3 + sqrof 5 and 3-sqrof 5 that are different from original solution

2.
U razvoju binoma
$`\left( x \sqrt[4]{x^{3}} + \frac{\sqrt{x}}{x^{2}} \right)^{n}`$
binomni koeficijenti petog i desetog ˇclana su jednaki. Odrediti onaj ˇclan razvoja koji ne sadrži x.  
here requires knowledge of basic formulas, nothing extra

3.
Na´ci peti ˇclan razvoja binoma $`\left( \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{\frac{1}{x}} \right)^n`$ ako je odnos koeficijenata tre´ceg i drugog
ˇclana jednak 7/2.
Do not forget that each term of the binomial starts from the zeroth term.
