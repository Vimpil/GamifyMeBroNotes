## Part 3: The Elliptic Trials

Master Ellipse led the young Jedi apprentices into the next chapter of their training, where they met Master Geometry, a wise teacher known for his love of numbers. With a wave of his hand, Master Geometry conjured holographic challenges, setting the stage for the Elliptic Trials.

"These trials," Master Geometry explained with a twinkle in his eye, "will test your math skills in adventurous ways. From calculating the chances of navigating asteroid fields to managing resources to aid communities, you'll use the power of elliptic math to tackle tricky situations. So, buckle up, young Jedi, for in these trials, you'll not only sharpen your minds but also pave your path to becoming galaxy-saving heroes!" And with that, the apprentices embarked on their mathematical adventure, ready to crunch numbers and conquer challenges in the name of the Force.

1. Odrediti jednačinu elipse koja sadrži tačke M(6, 4) i N(−8, 3).
Application of the standard ellipse formula is sufficient for the solution.

2. Find the tangents to the ellipse $\(9x^2 + 16y^2 = 144\)$ that are perpendicular to the line $\(p: x - y + 3 = 0\)$.  
Use the formula $\(x + y + p = 0\)$ for substitution into the ellipse equation and finding the zero discriminant, that is, the intersection between the ellipse and the tangents.
