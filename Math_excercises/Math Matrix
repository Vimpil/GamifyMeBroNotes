[Wolfram Demonstrations Project - Tetrahedron Volume: This site offers an interactive demonstration showing how the volume is calculated using determinants. You can manipulate the vertices to see how the volume changes.](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TetrahedronVolume/)

[Georgia Tech Textbook on Determinants and Volumes: This source explains the relationship between determinants and volumes, including detailed examples and visual aids that show how changing the rows of a matrix affects the volume of the parallelepiped it defines.](http://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/)
