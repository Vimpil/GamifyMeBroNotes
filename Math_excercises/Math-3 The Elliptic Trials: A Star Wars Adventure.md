## Part 3: The Elliptic Trials

Master Ellipse led the young Jedi apprentices into the next chapter of their training, where they met Master Geometry, a wise teacher known for his love of numbers. With a wave of his hand, Master Geometry conjured holographic challenges, setting the stage for the Elliptic Trials.

"These trials," Master Geometry explained with a twinkle in his eye, "will test your math skills in adventurous ways. From calculating the chances of navigating asteroid fields to managing resources to aid communities, you'll use the power of elliptic math to tackle tricky situations. So, buckle up, young Jedi, for in these trials, you'll not only sharpen your minds but also pave your path to becoming galaxy-saving heroes!" And with that, the apprentices embarked on their mathematical adventure, ready to crunch numbers and conquer challenges in the name of the Force.

1. Odrediti jednačinu elipse koja sadrži tačke M(6, 4) i N(−8, 3).
Application of the standard ellipse formula is sufficient for the solution.

2. Find the tangents to the ellipse $\(9x^2 + 16y^2 = 144\)$ that are perpendicular to the line $\(p: x - y + 3 = 0\)$.  
Use the formula $\(x + y + p = 0\)$ for substitution into the ellipse equation and finding the zero discriminant, that is, the intersection between the ellipse and the tangents.

3. Na elipsu \(3x^2 + y^2 = 48\) povučene su tangente iz tačke \(P(8, 0)\). Koliko iznosi ugao između ovih tangenti?
    1) Convert the equation of the ellipse to standard form.  
    2) Based on this equation, calculate the \(a\) and \(b\) of the ellipse.  
    3) Substitute \(P(0;8)\) into the ellipse equation with the point of intersection $\(\frac{x_0 x}{a^2} + \frac{y_0 y}{b^2} = 1\)$ to find $\(y\)$ as the point of     intersection. This is how the coordinates of the tangents' points of intersection with the ellipse are found.  
    4) Starting from point $\(P(0;8)\)$, substitute the values into $\(y = kx + b\)$, obtaining $\(b = -8k\)$; thus, $\(y = kx - 8k\)$. Substitute $\(y\)$ into the equation of the   ellipse to find the values of $\(k\)$ for the tangent lines. This requires bringing the equation to a quadratic form to obtain the solutions.  
    5) Use the formula for finding the tangent of the angle between two line equations: $\(\tan \theta = \frac{k_1 - k_2}{1 + k_1 k_2}\)$.  

4. Kroz tačku \( A(-2, -1) \) postaviti tetivu elipse \( x^2 + 4y^2 = 12 \), tako da \( A \) bude središte tetive.
elips equtation - > x0 and y0 elipse equatation; Count S that is equal to elipse equatation and counts instead of x in power of 2 -=> x0 in power of 2; y0 in power of 2, after you will count the equatation with this x0 and y0 than you will make it equal to x0x y0y and you will got the line function equatation.

5. Odredti jednaˇcinu elipse koju dodiruju prave x + y − 8 = 0 i x + 3y + 16 = 0.
$\[a^2 k^2 + b^2 = n^2\]$
where:
- `a` is the semi-major axis of the ellipse,
- `b` is the semi-minor axis of the ellipse,
- `k` is the slope of the tangent line,
- `n` is the y-intercept of the tangent line.

This formula is used to check the tangency condition between a line and an ellipse.
