# Part 4: The Stereometric Trials

Master Prism led the young Jedi apprentices into the next chapter of their training, where they met Master Geometry, a wise teacher known for his love of shapes. With a wave of his hand, Master Geometry conjured holographic challenges, setting the stage for the Stereometric Trials.

"These trials," Master Geometry explained with a twinkle in his eye, "will test your spatial reasoning in adventurous ways. From navigating the intricate architecture of ancient temples to constructing shelters for communities, you'll use the power of stereometry to tackle tricky situations. So, buckle up, young Jedi, for in these trials, you'll not only sharpen your minds but also pave your path to becoming galaxy-saving heroes!" 

And with that, the apprentices embarked on their geometric adventure, ready to measure volumes and conquer challenges in the name of the Force.

1. Ivice kvadra su tri uzasopna prirodna broja. Odrediti površinu tog kvadra ako je njegov dijagonalni presek kvadrat.
Make the sides variable with a difference in length as it is a series of consecutive natural numbers, calculate the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem, then calculate the volume of the cube.
2. Ivice kvadra su tri uzasopna prirodna broja. Odrediti površinu tog kvadra ako je njegov dijagonalni presek kvadrat.
Do not forget that the given area is that of the diagonal, everything else is quite clear.
