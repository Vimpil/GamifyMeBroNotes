### Problem 8.17

rite the equation of the circle circumscribed around triangle \( \triangle ABC \), where its vertices are \( A(2, 2) \), \( B(4, 6) \), and \( C(8, 8) \).

The general equation of a circle is:

\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \]

where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

To find the circumcenter \((h, k)\), we need to find the perpendicular bisectors of at least two sides of the triangle and their intersection point.
