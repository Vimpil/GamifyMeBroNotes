# Math-1 The Trigonometric Trials: A Star Wars Adventure

## Introduction:

In a galaxy far, far away, where the Force binds all things together, a group of young Jedi apprentices embarks on a quest to master the ancient art of trigonometry. Led by the wise Jedi Master Trigonos, they journey across the stars, facing challenges and battling dark forces along the way.

Our story begins on the peaceful planet of Coruscant, where the Jedi Temple stands as a beacon of knowledge and learning. In the heart of the temple, the Jedi Council has gathered to address the growing threat of the Sith, who seek to disrupt the balance of the Force.

Master Trigonos, renowned for his mastery of both the Force and mathematics, presents a bold plan to combat the Sith: to train a new generation of Jedi in the ways of trigonometry, harnessing its power to unlock the secrets of the universe and defeat the dark side once and for all.

As the chosen apprentices, you, along with your fellow Jedi hopefuls, are summoned to the Jedi Council chamber. There, Master Trigonos greets you with a solemn expression, his eyes shimmering with the wisdom of ages past.

$$\sqrt{3} \sin(3x) - \cos(3x) = 1$$

The main principle is to divide both parts by 2, resulting in:

$$\tan(3 \pi) = 3$$

which is equal to:

$$x = (-1)^{\text{k deg}} \cdot \frac{k \pi}{18} + \frac{\pi}{3} \cdot k$$

where \(x=(-1)^{\text{deg k}}\) makes it adaptable for both negative and positive positions.

---

$$2 \sin(2x) \sin(6x) = \cos(4x)$$

$$x = \frac{p}{16} + \frac{p}{8} k$$

This is a transformation of multiplication of sines in the left part of trigonometrical inequality.

1.

$$\frac{\sin(\frac{34 \pi}{15}) \cdot \tan(-1125°) \cdot \sin(242°)}{\cos(222°) \cdot \cot(\frac{7 \pi}{6}) \cdot \cos(-692°)}$$

The solution involves reducing angles to 360 degrees and transforming trigonometric functions with subsequent reductions. Afterward, \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\) is simplified.

2.

$$\frac{\tan\left(-\frac{10}{17}\pi\right) \cdot \sin(-744°) \cdot \cos\left(\frac{4}{7}\pi\right)}{\sin\left(-\frac{11}{6}\pi\right) \cdot \cos(-246°) \cdot \cot(396°)}$$

The key is trigonometric co-function identities.

---

3.1

$$2 \sin\left(3x - \frac{\Pi}{3}\right) = 1$$

$$x = -\frac{\Pi n}{18} + \frac{\Pi}{9} + \frac{\Pi k}{3}$$

The important thing is to move the two to the other side of the equation at the beginning.

3.2

$$\tan^2\left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{\Pi}{4}\right) = \sqrt{3}$$

Simple.

---

4.1

$$x = \frac{\Pi}{2} + \Pi k$$

and

$$x = -\frac{\Pi}{4} + \Pi k$$

\(-\frac{\Pi}{4}\) is mostly a matter of useful formatting for later use. Be careful about \(\frac{\cos(x)}{\sin(x)}\) if you are dividing by 0; it will be undefined, not 0.

4.2

$$\sin x = \frac{2 + \sqrt{2}}{2 \sqrt{2}}$$

Interesting.

---

5.

$$x = \frac{3\pi}{4} + 2\pi k$$

There is one more limit \( \pi \), I forgot to mention it.

6.

$$2\sin(x) + \cos(2x) > 1$$

$$\pi k < x < \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi k$$

The idea is to try to represent the functions as a single trigonometric function.

---

7.

$$2\sin^2\left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{\Pi}{4}\right) = \sqrt{3}$$

$$\tan\left(\pi\left(\frac{3}{2} + k\right)\right) = \tan\left(\pi k - 3\pi\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)$$

Interesting division of the result into two sides and then determining the remaining cotangent and tangent.

---

8.

$$\sqrt{3}\cos(4x) + \sin(4x) > \sqrt{2}$$

Here, the idea of dividing by both parts of the inequality is clearly implemented.

---

9.

$$4cos²(x) + 2(√3 - 1)cos(x) - √3 ≤ 0$$

This equation has one completely clear solution, while the second one can only be calculated with a calculator. The answer key does not provide the correct solution.

---

10.

In triangle 4ABC, determine the other basic elements if c = 3√2, α = 60°, and β = 75°.

second answer is different from the solution template \( \frac{3\sqrt{3} + 3}{\sqrt{2}} \)

---

11.

In triangle 4ABC, it is given: α = π/4, β = π/3, and the radius of the circumscribed circle R = 2√6. Determine the other basic elements of the triangle.

"All is easily found, the only thing worth remembering is the simplification of the answer: \( c = 6 + 2\sqrt{3} = 2(3+\sqrt{3}) \)"
